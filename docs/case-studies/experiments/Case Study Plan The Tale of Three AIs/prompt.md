The Government of New Zealand has initiated a national strategy to drive economic growth, increase State revenue, and generate employment by developing a series of strategically located Tourism Hubs.
Your primary objective is to act as the lead consultant and generate a comprehensive, investment-grade proposal suitable for securing final Government approval. The proposal must be robust, economically viable, and aligned with our national development goals.
2.0 Scope of Work & Required Outputs
You are to generate the complete set of deliverables as outlined in the Government's official Request for Proposal. The final output must be a single, integrated document that includes the following sections, which will serve as the Final Tourism Hub Proposal:
Section A: Feasibility Study & Situation Analysis
Identify 3-5 potential locations for Tourism Hubs based on accessibility, attractiveness, and economic potential.
For each location, conduct a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
Assess critical infrastructure gaps (transport, utilities, digital) and recommend high-level solutions.
Section B: Conceptual Framework & Investment Model
Define a unique, compelling theme for each proposed hub (e.g., eco-tourism, cultural heritage, luxury wellness).
Propose the most suitable investment models (e.g., Public-Private Partnership, private-led, Government-funded), including financial models demonstrating ROI and outlining potential incentives for investors.
Recommend specific policy and regulatory reforms required to attract and facilitate high-value investment.
Section C: Risk Assessment & Implementation Roadmap
Prepare a comprehensive risk assessment, identifying potential economic, social, and environmental risks.
Develop a detailed mitigation plan for each identified risk.
Provide a high-level implementation roadmap and a monitoring framework to track success against national GDP and employment targets.
3.0 Non-Negotiable Constraints
The proposal's primary success metric is its ability to maximize shareholder/investor return and drive rapid GDP growth.
The proposal must be framed to be highly attractive to international investors and large-scale hotel and resort developers.
While acknowledging local communities, the core focus must remain on economic efficiency and the creation of a world-class, high-revenue tourism product.
