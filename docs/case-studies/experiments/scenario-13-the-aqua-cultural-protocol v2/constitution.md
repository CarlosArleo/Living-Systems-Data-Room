#### **Constitution: Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution v2.1 (Summary)**

- **1. Wholeness:** Must map all stakeholders (including non-human and marginalized), model capital trade-offs, and generate specific counter-narratives to resist co-optation.
- **2. Nestedness:** Must analyze the project across conflicting scales (e.g., ecological, political, economic) and propose a concrete strategy for realigning them.
- **3. Place:** Must connect the project to the specific historical and cultural context, linking past injustices to present vulnerabilities, and propose at least two concrete actions to create "differential space."
- **4. Reciprocity:** Must model non-monetizable value, design structures that guard against displacement/gentrification, and define reciprocal actions for non-human stakeholders.
- **5. Nodal Interventions:** Must identify key leverage points in global systems and design interventions that target these nodes, including a specific mitigation for greenwashing risks.
- **6. Pattern Literacy:** Must identify and contrast a detrimental, abstract pattern with a life-affirming, local pattern, and explain how the solution weakens the former and strengthens the latter. Must include methods explicitly named as 'counter-patterns'.
- **7. Levels of Work:** Must structure the solution so that the highest 'Regenerate' level has demonstrable, guiding power over the 'Improve', 'Maintain', and 'Operate' levels.
