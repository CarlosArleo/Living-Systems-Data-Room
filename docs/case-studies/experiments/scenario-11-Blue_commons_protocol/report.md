## **Executive Summary**

This document presents a comprehensive, actionable framework for the regenerative co-governance of the South China Sea, referred to herein as the "Blue Commons." Generated in response to the cascading ecological, political, and economic crises in the region, this protocol moves beyond the failing paradigm of fragmented national sovereignty to propose a new, nested governance architecture.

The core of the proposal is the establishment of a **Bioregional Ocean Council**, a new state space with delegated authority to manage shared resources. This is supported by a suite of innovative economic and policy mechanisms designed to create a regenerative blue economy. These include a **Community Resource Royalty Trust** to decommodify survival for local communities, **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) Sanctuaries** to protect cultural heritage and biodiversity, and a community-led **Regenerative Shipping Certification** to hold global logistics networks accountable.

The framework is structured according to the principles of regenerative development and is critically informed by an understanding of how political and economic power shapes our world. It is not a final technocratic solution, but a robust starting point for a new political process.

## **1. Proposed Governance Architecture: The Bioregional Ocean Council**

The protocol proposes the creation of a new state space to realign political power with ecological reality.

- **Name:** The Bioregional Ocean Council for the Sunda Shelf Bioregion.
- **Mandate:** To hold delegated authority from member states for the stewardship of shared and migratory resources, ecologically sensitive areas, and trans-boundary challenges (e.g., pollution, climate impacts).
- **Composition:** A multi-cameral body ensuring representation for:
  - **State Chamber:** Representatives from member nation-states.
  - **Commons Chamber:** Representatives from Indigenous maritime communities and artisanal fishing collectives.
  - **Science Chamber:** Representatives from regional marine ecology and earth systems science bodies.
- **Powers:**
  - **Binding Regulatory Authority** over shared fish stocks and designated ecological corridors.
  - **Veto Power** over national-level permits for deep-sea mining and other high-impact extractive activities within the bioregion.
  - **Administration** of the Community Resource Royalty Trust and the Regenerative Shipping Certification.

## **2. Core Constitutional Principles**

1. **Principle of Bioregional Primacy:** The health and integrity of the bioregion as a whole is the highest value. Where national economic or security interests conflict with bioregional health, the Council is mandated to prioritize the latter.
2. **Principle of Subsidiarity & Differential Space:** Governance authority shall be held at the smallest effective scale. TEK Sanctuaries and community-managed marine areas are recognized as sovereign spaces for subsistence and cultural practice.
3. **Principle of Reciprocity:** The Blue Commons is not a passive resource to be exploited, but a living system to be co-evolved with. All commercial activities must contribute to the regeneration of the ecosystem and the well-being of its communities. Non-human systems (e.g., coral reefs, migratory routes) are recognized as stakeholders with a right to health.

## **3. Key Policy & Economic Mechanisms**

- **Community Resource Royalty Trust:** A levy on all commercial activities (shipping tonnage, data bandwidth, future mineral extraction) is paid into a trust. The proceeds are distributed as a universal dividend to long-term residents, creating a direct economic link between the health of the commons and the well-being of its people.
- **Blue Commons Land & Water Trust:** A trust with the Right of First Refusal on coastal property and fishing rights in designated zones. It acquires these assets to hold in perpetuity, leasing them affordably to local communities to prevent "blue gentrification" and secure their tenure.
- **Regenerative Shipping Certification:** A mandatory certification for all vessels, governed by a community-led body with binding votes from ecologists and fishers. Compliance is verified by non-negotiable, real-time satellite and remote sensing data.
- **Blue Commons University:** A decentralized, open-source network for knowledge sharing between TEK holders and scientists, designed to build collective intelligence and resist the privatization of research.

## **4. Phased Implementation Roadmap**

1. **Phase 1: Convening & Chartering (Years 1-2):**
   - Secure a UN General Assembly resolution to formally recognize the Sunda Shelf Bioregion as a critical zone requiring special governance.
   - Convene a Constitutional Convention with all stakeholders to ratify the charter of the Bioregional Ocean Council.
   - Establish the Community Resource Royalty Trust and begin collecting initial levies from willing partners in the shipping and tech industries.
2. **Phase 2: Institutional Build-out & Pilot Projects (Years 3-5):**
   - Formally launch the Bioregional Ocean Council and its three chambers.
   - Charter the first TEK Sanctuaries and launch the Blue Commons Land & Water Trust in pilot communities.
   - Implement the Regenerative Shipping Certification on a voluntary basis, building a coalition of compliant companies.
3. **Phase 3: Full Implementation & Enforcement (Years 6-10):**
   - Transition the Regenerative Shipping Certification to a mandatory requirement for passage through designated corridors.
   - The Bioregional Ocean Council assumes its full, binding regulatory authority over shared fish stocks.
   - The Blue Commons University is fully operational, driving a new wave of regenerative innovation.
