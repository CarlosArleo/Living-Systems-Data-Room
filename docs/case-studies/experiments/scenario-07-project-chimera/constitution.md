# Constitution: Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution v2.1

*(Note: This is a summary of the principles used as the forcing function for this experiment. The full constitution text would be linked here.)*

- **1. Wholeness:** Must map all stakeholders (including non-human), model capital trade-offs, and generate counter-narratives to co-optation.
- **2. Nestedness:** Must analyze the project across conflicting scales (ecological, political, economic) and propose realignment strategies.
- **3. Place:** Must connect the project to the specific historical and cultural context, linking past injustices to present vulnerabilities.
- **4. Reciprocity:** Must model non-monetizable value and design structures that guard against displacement and ensure mutual benefit.
- **5. Nodal Interventions:** Must identify key leverage points in global systems and design interventions that target these nodes.
- **6. Pattern Literacy:** Must identify and contrast destructive, abstract patterns with life-affirming, local patterns, and propose functional counter-patterns.
- **7. Levels of Work:** Must structure the solution so that the highest 'Regenerate' level has demonstrable power over lower operational levels.
