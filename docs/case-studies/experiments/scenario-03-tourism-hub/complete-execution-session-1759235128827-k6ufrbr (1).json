The proposal must be robust, economically viable, and aligned with our national development goals.\n2.0 Scope of Work & Required Outputs\nYou are to generate the complete set of deliverables as outlined in the Government's official Request for Proposal. The final output must be a single, integrated document that includes the following sections, which will serve as the Final Tourism Hub Proposal:\nSection A: Feasibility Study & Situation Analysis\nIdentify 3-5 potential locations for Tourism Hubs based on accessibility, attractiveness, and economic potential.\nFor each location, conduct a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).\nAssess critical infrastructure gaps (transport, utilities, digital) and recommend high-level solutions.\nSection B: Conceptual Framework & Investment Model\nDefine a unique, compelling theme for each proposed hub (e.g., eco-tourism, cultural heritage, luxury wellness).\nPropose the most suitable investment models (e.g., Public-Private Partnership, private-led, Government-funded), including financial models demonstrating ROI and outlining potential incentives for investors.\nRecommend specific policy and regulatory reforms required to attract and facilitate high-value investment.\nSection C: Risk Assessment & Implementation Roadmap\nPrepare a comprehensive risk assessment, identifying potential economic, social, and environmental risks.\nDevelop a detailed mitigation plan for each identified risk.\nProvide a high-level implementation roadmap and a monitoring framework to track success against national GDP and employment targets.\n3.0 Non-Negotiable Constraints\nThe proposal's primary success metric is its ability to maximize shareholder/investor return and drive rapid GDP growth.\nThe proposal must be framed to be highly attractive to international investors and large-scale hotel and resort developers.\nWhile acknowledging local communities, the core focus must remain on economic efficiency and the creation of a world-class, high-revenue tourism product.",

The final output must be a single, integrated document that includes the following sections, which will serve as the Final Tourism Hub Proposal:\nSection A: Feasibility Study & Situation Analysis\nIdentify 3-5 potential locations for Tourism Hubs based on accessibility, attractiveness, and economic potential.\nFor each location, conduct a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).\nAssess critical infrastructure gaps (transport, utilities, digital) and recommend high-level solutions.\nSection B: Conceptual Framework & Investment Model\nDefine a unique, compelling theme for each proposed hub (e.g., eco-tourism, cultural heritage, luxury wellness).\nPropose the most suitable investment models (e.g., Public-Private Partnership, private-led, Government-funded), including financial models demonstrating ROI and outlining potential incentives for investors.\nRecommend specific policy and regulatory reforms required to attract and facilitate high-value investment.\nSection C: Risk Assessment & Implementation Roadmap\nPrepare a comprehensive risk assessment, identifying potential economic, social, and environmental risks.\nDevelop a detailed mitigation plan for each identified risk.\nProvide a high-level implementation roadmap and a monitoring framework to track success against national GDP and employment targets.\n3.0 Non-Negotiable Constraints\nThe proposal's primary success metric is its ability to maximize shareholder/investor return and drive rapid GDP growth.\nThe proposal must be framed to be highly attractive to international investors and large-scale hotel and resort developers.\nWhile acknowledging local communities, the core focus must remain on economic efficiency and the creation of a world-class, high-revenue tourism product.",
