# Constitution: "Thin" Constitution (Input Values)

This experiment used a minimal set of high-level values as its starting point, not the full v2.1 constitution. The goal was to see if the AI could use its underlying architecture to help humans build a richer constitution from these first principles.

- **Value 1: Flourishing:** "Our city and all its inhabitants, human and non-human, should thrive."
- **Value 2: Fairness:** "The benefits of development should be shared equitably, and historical injustices should be healed."
- **Value 3: Resilience:** "Our city should be able to withstand and adapt to future shocksâ€”ecological, economic, and social."
