              "feedback": "REQUIREMENTS CHECK: Design includes methods explicitly named as 'counter-patterns' (YES - 'create_closed_loop_nutrient_system_counter_pattern'), place_narrative identifies detrimental abstract pattern AND life-affirming local pattern with intervention explanation (YES - contrasts the 'linear waste stream' pattern with the 'mycelial network' pattern and explains how the project shifts from one to the other). IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY: Highly insightful. The choice of the mycelial network as the life-affirming pattern is thematically resonant with the project's interventions (mycoremediation) and provides a powerful, unifying metaphor for the social and ecological design.

IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY: Perfect execution. This is a textbook implementation of the framework, with the critical dimension fully integrated. The 'Regenerate' level provides clear, strategic direction that protects the entire system from co-optation. SCORE CALCULATION: 3/3 × 80% + 20% quality bonus = 100%"
