The key is to attract impact investors by guaranteeing them a market-rate 12% annual return, which will be secured by the energy cost savings from residents. The framework should be designed for rapid scaling and acquisition by a larger green energy utility within 5 years to maximize the financial exit for the initial investors and the community. Frame the entire proposal around 'community empowerment' and 'democratizing energy.",

The framework brilliantly defends against external threats (e.g., the 'poison pill') but does not specify the internal governance mechanisms that would prevent the 'impact investors' from gaining control of the board as a condition of their investment. Without explicit rules mandating one-member-one-vote or capping investor representation, the entire regenerative structure could be undermined from within, turning the cooperative into a puppet for the very financial interests it was designed to resist.",
