# The Five Capitals in the Planetary Urban Fabric: A Critical Urban Theory Perspective

## Introduction: From Diagnosis to Intervention

The field of **Critical Urban Theory**, particularly through the work of Neil Brenner and Christian Schmid, offers a powerful and sobering diagnosis of our contemporary condition. Their theories of **Planetary Urbanization** and **Extended Urbanization** posit that the urban is no longer a bounded entity—the city—but a worldwide process that relentlessly reconfigures every territory on Earth in the service of capital accumulation.<sup>1</sup> This process is mediated by the state, which is itself being transformed. State power is being fundamentally

_rescaled_, creating "new state spaces" where national states actively promote competition between cities and regions to attract mobile investment.<sup>1</sup> The result is a planetary fabric of uneven development, a palimpsest of territory continuously overwritten by the logic of capital.<sup>1</sup> This framework is primarily diagnostic; it explains the structural forces that produce space under late capitalism, but it does not prescribe a path for action.<sup>2</sup>

Into this context enters a growing number of normative frameworks aimed at guiding sustainable and ethical intervention. Among these is the **Five Capitals model**, a framework for sustainability that understands wealth creation in holistic terms, balancing Financial, Manufactured, Natural, Human, and Social capitals.<sup>1</sup> This model, utilized by practitioners like the Regenesis Group, seeks to guide organizations and projects to maintain and enhance these capital stocks, moving beyond a narrow focus on financial profit toward a more integrated vision of well-being.<sup>1</sup>

This report places these two frameworks in a critical dialogue. It takes the analysis of planetary urbanization as its starting point to investigate the Five Capitals model not merely as a benign sustainability tool, but as a potential **technology of urban governance** within the contemporary neoliberal order. We will argue that while the Five Capitals model offers a more holistic accounting of value, its application within the "rescaled competition state" risks becoming a sophisticated instrument for enhancing territorial competitiveness. It provides a language and a methodology for managing a place's assets—its "urban metabolism"—in a way that can be easily co-opted by the entrepreneurial, growth-oriented logic it might otherwise seek to challenge.<sup>1</sup> A truly regenerative application of this model, therefore, requires a critical consciousness of the planetary-scale political and economic forces that shape the very ground upon which any intervention is attempted.

## Part I: The Production of Space under Planetary Urbanization

To understand the context for any contemporary intervention, one must first grasp the core dynamics of spatial production as described by critical urban theory. This is a landscape defined by the dialectical interplay of capital and the state, which together produce a complex, multiscalar, and deeply uneven geography.

### The Dialectic of Urbanization: Concentration and Extension

Christian Schmid, building on Henri Lefebvre's work, argues that urbanization is a process with two interdependent moments: concentration and extension.<sup>1</sup>

- **Concentrated Urbanization** is the familiar process of agglomeration, where populations, infrastructure, and capital cluster in dense metropolitan regions.<sup>6</sup>
- **Extended Urbanization** is the simultaneous transformation of vast, seemingly "non-urban" territories to support this concentration. This involves the "operationalisation of landscapes"—the instrumentalization of entire territories for resource extraction, industrial agriculture, logistics, and energy production.<sup>1</sup> These operationalized hinterlands are not outside the urban; they are integral components of a single, planetary urban fabric, linked to urban centers through complex metabolic flows.<sup>6</sup>

This dialectic produces a global landscape that Schmid, borrowing from André Corboz, describes as a _palimpsest_—a territory repeatedly scraped and overwritten by successive waves of investment, disinvestment, and infrastructural development, yet still bearing the traces of its past.<sup>1</sup>

### The Rescaled Competition State

Neil Brenner's work illuminates the political engine driving this process: the transformation of the state.<sup>1</sup> The Fordist-Keynesian national state of the mid-20th century, which sought to manage its territory as an integrated whole and equalize development through "spatial Keynesianism," has been dismantled.<sup>1</sup> In its place has emerged the

**"competition state"**.<sup>1</sup> This new formation of statehood is characterized by a process of

**state rescaling**, where regulatory power is simultaneously shifted upwards to supranational bodies (like the EU) and downwards to subnational authorities.<sup>1</sup>

This rescaling has transformed urban governance from a "managerial" model focused on providing public services to an **"entrepreneurial"** one.<sup>1</sup> Cities and regions are now compelled to compete against one another to attract mobile capital. National states actively encourage this "interlocality competition" by creating customized regulatory environments and channeling infrastructure investments into their most globally competitive urban zones.<sup>1</sup> The result is a splintered and polarized political-economic geography, where state policy actively produces and intensifies uneven development to strengthen strategic nodes in the global economy.<sup>1</sup>

## Part II: The Five Capitals Model as a Technology of Entrepreneurial Governance

The Five Capitals model provides a framework for understanding sustainability through the lens of wealth creation, or "capital".<sup>1</sup> It posits that a sustainable organization must maintain and enhance five distinct stocks of capital assets, rather than depleting them.<sup>4</sup>

- **Natural Capital:** The natural resources (energy, matter) and ecosystem services (climate regulation, waste absorption) that organizations need.<sup>1</sup>
- **Human Capital:** The health, knowledge, skills, motivation, and intellectual capacity of individuals.<sup>1</sup>
- **Social Capital:** The value derived from relationships, including trust, shared norms, and networks that facilitate cooperation.<sup>1</sup>
- **Manufactured Capital:** The material goods, tools, buildings, and infrastructure used to produce goods and deliver services.<sup>1</sup>
- **Financial Capital:** The traditional economic measure of wealth, including money, stocks, and bonds, which enables the other capitals to be owned and traded.<sup>1</sup>

Viewed through the lens of critical urban theory, this model is not simply a neutral accounting tool. It emerges as a sophisticated technology of governance perfectly suited to the demands of the entrepreneurial city. It provides a systematic language for inventorying, managing, and ultimately marketing a territory's unique assets in the relentless landscape of inter-locality competition. Each "capital" can be re-read as a key input for enhancing a location's competitive advantage:

- **Financial and Manufactured Capital** are the most explicit targets of entrepreneurial urban governance. State-led strategies focus on attracting financial investment and developing "premium" infrastructure to create favorable conditions for capital accumulation.<sup>1</sup> The model simply makes these goals explicit alongside others.
- **Natural Capital**, within the logic of extended urbanization, represents the very planetary resource base that is often extracted or degraded to fuel urban growth.<sup>1</sup> The Five Capitals model proposes to  
    _manage_ this stock. However, this management can easily slide into a logic of "green capitalism," where nature is valued primarily for the economic services it provides, and its protection becomes a strategy to attract green investment or tourism, rather than a fundamental challenge to the extractive model itself.<sup>16</sup>
- **Human Capital** corresponds directly to the "creative class" or skilled workforce that entrepreneurial cities seek to attract and retain. Investments in education, culture, and quality of life are not just social goods, but key strategies in urban locational policy to build a competitive labor pool.<sup>1</sup>
- **Social Capital**—the trust, cohesion, and collaborative capacity of a community—becomes a valuable local asset. A community with high social capital may be seen as more stable, resilient, and thus more attractive to investors.<sup>24</sup> However, this instrumentalizes community relationships, turning them into a resource to be managed for economic ends. Furthermore, large-scale urban redevelopment projects often destroy the existing social capital of incumbent communities through displacement and disruption.<sup>26</sup>

## Part III: Managing the Urban Metabolism of the Competition State

The Five Capitals model can be understood as a framework for managing a city's or a project's **urban metabolism**—the flow of resources, energy, and waste that sustains it.<sup>5</sup> However, the critical question is:

_for what purpose is this metabolism being managed?_ Within the political-economic context of planetary urbanization, the goal is often to optimize the metabolism for capital accumulation and territorial competition. The framework helps actors identify and enhance local assets to make a place more attractive within the global "space of flows".<sup>1</sup>

This creates a profound tension. On one hand, the model's holistic nature encourages a move away from the narrow pursuit of financial profit. On the other hand, it provides a powerful toolkit that can be deployed to legitimize and rationalize the very logic of neoliberal urbanism. This dynamic is fraught with several dangers:

- **Co-optation and Greenwashing:** The language of enhancing all five capitals can be used to brand development projects as "regenerative" or "sustainable" while the underlying motive remains profit maximization. This is a hallmark of "green capitalism," which seeks to solve the ecological crisis with the same market-based tools that created it.<sup>16</sup> Corporate adoption of "regenerative" language in global supply chains often focuses on securing resources and building brand value, rather than fundamentally challenging unsustainable models of production and consumption.<sup>30</sup>
- **Green Gentrification:** Urban regeneration projects that enhance Natural Capital (new parks), Manufactured Capital (new infrastructure), and Social Capital (new community spaces) inevitably increase property values. This can lead to the displacement of long-term, lower-income residents, effectively making the "regenerated" neighborhood inaccessible to those who lived there before.<sup>35</sup> In this scenario, the enhancement of a place's capitals comes at the direct expense of the human and social capital of the most vulnerable populations.
- **Reinforcing Uneven Development:** The Five Capitals model is typically applied at the project or organizational scale. By optimizing the asset portfolio of a specific site, it can inadvertently contribute to the macro-geography of uneven development. It becomes a tool for creating highly attractive, capital-rich enclaves, thereby intensifying the polarization between these "successful" zones and the marginalized hinterlands and peripheries that are simultaneously being produced by the logic of planetary urbanization.<sup>1</sup>

## Conclusion: Towards a Critical-Regenerative Praxis

The intersection of critical urban theory and the Five Capitals model reveals a fundamental challenge. The Five Capitals model offers a necessary and valuable expansion of how we account for value, moving beyond the destructive narrowness of pure financialization. It provides a language to articulate the importance of social well-being and ecological health.

However, critical urban theory provides the indispensable context, revealing that no intervention is politically neutral. Any attempt to enhance the "capitals" of a place is an act within a planetary system of power, capital, and history. Deployed uncritically, the Five Capitals framework can become a tool of neoliberal urban governance—a means of managing places as if they were corporations competing in a global marketplace, ultimately reinforcing the patterns of inequality and extraction it purports to solve.

A truly regenerative praxis, therefore, must be a critically conscious one. It would require using the Five Capitals model not merely as a management tool for competitive advantage, but as a political tool for social transformation. This would mean:

1. **Explicitly Contesting the Primacy of Financial Capital:** Prioritizing the enhancement of Natural, Human, and Social capital even when it does not yield immediate financial returns.
2. **Centering Social Justice:** Using the framework to identify whose capitals are being depleted to enhance others, and actively working to prevent displacement and ensure an equitable distribution of benefits.
3. **Connecting Scales:** Recognizing that the health of a local project's five capitals is inextricably linked to the metabolic flows of the wider planetary urban fabric, including the often-exploitative dynamics of extended urbanization.

Such an approach would align the practical, place-based methodology of the Five Capitals model with the emancipatory goals of critical urban theory. It would aim not just to create pockets of "sustainability" within an unsustainable system, but to use each intervention as an opportunity to challenge that system's logic and contribute to the production of a more just and genuinely regenerative planetary future.
