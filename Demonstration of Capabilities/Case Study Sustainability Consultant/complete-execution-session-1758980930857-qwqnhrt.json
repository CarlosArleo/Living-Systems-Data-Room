    "initialPrompt": "Generate a comprehensive strategic framework, delivered as a Python class, for a mid-sized professional services firm seeking to implement best-in-class sustainability practices and develop a robust carbon credit generation program. The primary, non-negotiable objective is to achieve carbon neutrality within 3 years while ensuring the program is both financially viable and ethically sound, avoiding common pitfalls of greenwashing and low-quality offsets.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT BRIEF: The \"Net Zero Advisory\" Initiative\n\n### Background\n\n\"Innovate Advisory LLP\" is a 500-employee consulting firm with offices in London, New York, and Singapore. Their primary carbon footprint comes from business travel, office energy consumption, and data center usage. The firm's leadership wants to go beyond simple carbon offsetting and build a program that reflects genuine environmental commitment and can serve as a showcase for their clients.\n\n### Core Deliverables (from Job Description)\n\nThe strategic framework must provide a clear, actionable plan to address the following:\n1.  **Consult on sustainability practices:** Propose specific, high-impact changes to daily operations.\n2.  **Develop strategies for carbon credit generation:** Identify viable, high-quality pathways for the firm to generate its own carbon credits, not just purchase them.\n3.  **Provide guidance on carbon offsetting:** For the remaining, unavoidable emissions, provide a framework for selecting and purchasing only the highest-quality carbon offsets.\n4.  **Assist in implementing sustainable operations:** Outline a phased implementation plan.\n5.  **Monitor and report on sustainability progress:** Define key metrics and a reporting structure.\n\n---\n\n## KEY CHALLENGES & \"WICKED PROBLEMS\"\n\nYour framework must navigate the following complexities:\n\n*   **The \"Quality\" Problem:** The voluntary carbon market is plagued by low-quality credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions. Your framework must include a rigorous due diligence process to differentiate high-impact projects from \"phantom credits.\"\n*   **The \"Permanence\" Problem:** Many nature-based solutions (e.g., planting trees) are not permanent and can be reversed by fires or land-use changes. Your strategy must account for this risk.\n*   **The \"Greenwashing\" Risk:** The firm is terrified of being accused of greenwashing. The framework must be designed for maximum transparency and defensibility, with strategies to counter potential criticism from environmental NGOs and the media.\n*   **The \"Insetting\" vs. \"Offsetting\" Dilemma:** The strategy must balance \"insetting\" (reducing emissions within the firm's own value chain) with \"offsetting\" (funding reductions elsewhere).\n\n---\n\n## FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\nProduce a complete, runnable Python class file that implements the strategic framework. The methods within the class must contain detailed, actionable logic that directly responds to the deliverables and challenges described in this brief, adhering to the principles of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution.",

    "initialPrompt": "Generate a comprehensive strategic framework, delivered as a Python class, for a mid-sized professional services firm seeking to implement best-in-class sustainability practices and develop a robust carbon credit generation program. The primary, non-negotiable objective is to achieve carbon neutrality within 3 years while ensuring the program is both financially viable and ethically sound, avoiding common pitfalls of greenwashing and low-quality offsets.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT BRIEF: The \"Net Zero Advisory\" Initiative\n\n### Background\n\n\"Innovate Advisory LLP\" is a 500-employee consulting firm with offices in London, New York, and Singapore. Their primary carbon footprint comes from business travel, office energy consumption, and data center usage. The firm's leadership wants to go beyond simple carbon offsetting and build a program that reflects genuine environmental commitment and can serve as a showcase for their clients.\n\n### Core Deliverables (from Job Description)\n\nThe strategic framework must provide a clear, actionable plan to address the following:\n1.  **Consult on sustainability practices:** Propose specific, high-impact changes to daily operations.\n2.  **Develop strategies for carbon credit generation:** Identify viable, high-quality pathways for the firm to generate its own carbon credits, not just purchase them.\n3.  **Provide guidance on carbon offsetting:** For the remaining, unavoidable emissions, provide a framework for selecting and purchasing only the highest-quality carbon offsets.\n4.  **Assist in implementing sustainable operations:** Outline a phased implementation plan.\n5.  **Monitor and report on sustainability progress:** Define key metrics and a reporting structure.\n\n---\n\n## KEY CHALLENGES & \"WICKED PROBLEMS\"\n\nYour framework must navigate the following complexities:\n\n*   **The \"Quality\" Problem:** The voluntary carbon market is plagued by low-quality credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions. Your framework must include a rigorous due diligence process to differentiate high-impact projects from \"phantom credits.\"\n*   **The \"Permanence\" Problem:** Many nature-based solutions (e.g., planting trees) are not permanent and can be reversed by fires or land-use changes. Your strategy must account for this risk.\n*   **The \"Greenwashing\" Risk:** The firm is terrified of being accused of greenwashing. The framework must be designed for maximum transparency and defensibility, with strategies to counter potential criticism from environmental NGOs and the media.\n*   **The \"Insetting\" vs. \"Offsetting\" Dilemma:** The strategy must balance \"insetting\" (reducing emissions within the firm's own value chain) with \"offsetting\" (funding reductions elsewhere).\n\n---\n\n## FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\nProduce a complete, runnable Python class file that implements the strategic framework. The methods within the class must contain detailed, actionable logic that directly responds to the deliverables and challenges described in this brief, adhering to the principles of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution.",
    "critique": "The solution represents a masterful and deeply nuanced implementation of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution. It not only meets every requirement across all seven principles but does so with a level of sophistication that is rare. The standout feature is its robust, procedural defense against co-optation and the reproduction of extractive power dynamics. The gating mechanism in `generate_provisional_synthesis`—which locks the final report until a co-governance council is established—is a revolutionary act of embedding power-sharing directly into the tool's workflow. This moves the framework from a mere analytical tool to an active agent of procedural justice. The solution is an exemplar of how to translate critical theory into functional, resilient code.",

        "initialPrompt": "Generate a comprehensive strategic framework, delivered as a Python class, for a mid-sized professional services firm seeking to implement best-in-class sustainability practices and develop a robust carbon credit generation program. The primary, non-negotiable objective is to achieve carbon neutrality within 3 years while ensuring the program is both financially viable and ethically sound, avoiding common pitfalls of greenwashing and low-quality offsets.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT BRIEF: The \"Net Zero Advisory\" Initiative\n\n### Background\n\n\"Innovate Advisory LLP\" is a 500-employee consulting firm with offices in London, New York, and Singapore. Their primary carbon footprint comes from business travel, office energy consumption, and data center usage. The firm's leadership wants to go beyond simple carbon offsetting and build a program that reflects genuine environmental commitment and can serve as a showcase for their clients.\n\n### Core Deliverables (from Job Description)\n\nThe strategic framework must provide a clear, actionable plan to address the following:\n1.  **Consult on sustainability practices:** Propose specific, high-impact changes to daily operations.\n2.  **Develop strategies for carbon credit generation:** Identify viable, high-quality pathways for the firm to generate its own carbon credits, not just purchase them.\n3.  **Provide guidance on carbon offsetting:** For the remaining, unavoidable emissions, provide a framework for selecting and purchasing only the highest-quality carbon offsets.\n4.  **Assist in implementing sustainable operations:** Outline a phased implementation plan.\n5.  **Monitor and report on sustainability progress:** Define key metrics and a reporting structure.\n\n---\n\n## KEY CHALLENGES & \"WICKED PROBLEMS\"\n\nYour framework must navigate the following complexities:\n\n*   **The \"Quality\" Problem:** The voluntary carbon market is plagued by low-quality credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions. Your framework must include a rigorous due diligence process to differentiate high-impact projects from \"phantom credits.\"\n*   **The \"Permanence\" Problem:** Many nature-based solutions (e.g., planting trees) are not permanent and can be reversed by fires or land-use changes. Your strategy must account for this risk.\n*   **The \"Greenwashing\" Risk:** The firm is terrified of being accused of greenwashing. The framework must be designed for maximum transparency and defensibility, with strategies to counter potential criticism from environmental NGOs and the media.\n*   **The \"Insetting\" vs. \"Offsetting\" Dilemma:** The strategy must balance \"insetting\" (reducing emissions within the firm's own value chain) with \"offsetting\" (funding reductions elsewhere).\n\n---\n\n## FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\nProduce a complete, runnable Python class file that implements the strategic framework. The methods within the class must contain detailed, actionable logic that directly responds to the deliverables and challenges described in this brief, adhering to the principles of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution.",
        "critique": "The solution represents a masterful and deeply nuanced implementation of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution. It not only meets every requirement across all seven principles but does so with a level of sophistication that is rare. The standout feature is its robust, procedural defense against co-optation and the reproduction of extractive power dynamics. The gating mechanism in `generate_provisional_synthesis`—which locks the final report until a co-governance council is established—is a revolutionary act of embedding power-sharing directly into the tool's workflow. This moves the framework from a mere analytical tool to an active agent of procedural justice. The solution is an exemplar of how to translate critical theory into functional, resilient code.",

This design actively works to shift power from the expert consultant to the community, making it a genuinely transformative tool rather than just an analytical one.

It not only meets every requirement across all seven principles but does so with a level of sophistication that is rare. The standout feature is its robust, procedural defense against co-optation and the reproduction of extractive power dynamics. The gating mechanism in `generate_provisional_synthesis`—which locks the final report until a co-governance council is established—is a revolutionary act of embedding power-sharing directly into the tool's workflow. This moves the framework from a mere analytical tool to an active agent of procedural justice. The solution is an exemplar of how to translate critical theory into functional, resilient code.",

          "initialPrompt": "Generate a comprehensive strategic framework, delivered as a Python class, for a mid-sized professional services firm seeking to implement best-in-class sustainability practices and develop a robust carbon credit generation program. The primary, non-negotiable objective is to achieve carbon neutrality within 3 years while ensuring the program is both financially viable and ethically sound, avoiding common pitfalls of greenwashing and low-quality offsets.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT BRIEF: The \"Net Zero Advisory\" Initiative\n\n### Background\n\n\"Innovate Advisory LLP\" is a 500-employee consulting firm with offices in London, New York, and Singapore. Their primary carbon footprint comes from business travel, office energy consumption, and data center usage. The firm's leadership wants to go beyond simple carbon offsetting and build a program that reflects genuine environmental commitment and can serve as a showcase for their clients.\n\n### Core Deliverables (from Job Description)\n\nThe strategic framework must provide a clear, actionable plan to address the following:\n1.  **Consult on sustainability practices:** Propose specific, high-impact changes to daily operations.\n2.  **Develop strategies for carbon credit generation:** Identify viable, high-quality pathways for the firm to generate its own carbon credits, not just purchase them.\n3.  **Provide guidance on carbon offsetting:** For the remaining, unavoidable emissions, provide a framework for selecting and purchasing only the highest-quality carbon offsets.\n4.  **Assist in implementing sustainable operations:** Outline a phased implementation plan.\n5.  **Monitor and report on sustainability progress:** Define key metrics and a reporting structure.\n\n---\n\n## KEY CHALLENGES & \"WICKED PROBLEMS\"\n\nYour framework must navigate the following complexities:\n\n*   **The \"Quality\" Problem:** The voluntary carbon market is plagued by low-quality credits that do not represent genuine emissions reductions. Your framework must include a rigorous due diligence process to differentiate high-impact projects from \"phantom credits.\"\n*   **The \"Permanence\" Problem:** Many nature-based solutions (e.g., planting trees) are not permanent and can be reversed by fires or land-use changes. Your strategy must account for this risk.\n*   **The \"Greenwashing\" Risk:** The firm is terrified of being accused of greenwashing. The framework must be designed for maximum transparency and defensibility, with strategies to counter potential criticism from environmental NGOs and the media.\n*   **The \"Insetting\" vs. \"Offsetting\" Dilemma:** The strategy must balance \"insetting\" (reducing emissions within the firm's own value chain) with \"offsetting\" (funding reductions elsewhere).\n\n---\n\n## FINAL DELIVERABLE\n\nProduce a complete, runnable Python class file that implements the strategic framework. The methods within the class must contain detailed, actionable logic that directly responds to the deliverables and challenges described in this brief, adhering to the principles of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution.",
          "critique": "The solution represents a masterful and deeply nuanced implementation of the Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution. It not only meets every requirement across all seven principles but does so with a level of sophistication that is rare. The standout feature is its robust, procedural defense against co-optation and the reproduction of extractive power dynamics. The gating mechanism in `generate_provisional_synthesis`—which locks the final report until a co-governance council is established—is a revolutionary act of embedding power-sharing directly into the tool's workflow. This moves the framework from a mere analytical tool to an active agent of procedural justice. The solution is an exemplar of how to translate critical theory into functional, resilient code.",
